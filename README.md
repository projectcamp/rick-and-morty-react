# rick and morty react

This project you will demonstrate proficiency by creating an application that uses ReactJS to consume live data retrieved from the World Wide Web and style that data nicely on the page.

## Description

In this challenge, create a web page that presents a styled list of **characters obtained from an API**. Being able to render out data to a web page is a large part of what JavaScript developers do, this challenge assesses your ability to achieve such a task.


## Project Set Up

1. Create a Github account if you don't have one already. 
2. Download VS Code if you haven't already. Link here: https://code.visualstudio.com/download
3. Fork this repository by clicking the button "fork" in the upper right. 
4. Copy the URL of the new repository by clicking the green "Click or download" button in your repository and clicking the copy icon.
5.  Create a new folder where you want to store this project. You can call it something like "Coding" or "ProjectCamp".
6.  Go to your computers terminal application by typing "terminal" in your copmuters search.  At the command line, navigate to the folder by using the "cd" command. For example: "cd desktop", "cd projectcamp" 
7. Once you are at your desired folder location, clone your new repository by typing `git clone {paste the URL here}`
8. type `cd rick-and-morty-react`
9. type `npm install` to retrieve all the dependencies. 
10. type `npm start` to start the server
11. Go to http://localhost:3000 - you should see a nice Rick and Morty background"
12. Open up VS code and click "open". Select the `rick-and-morty-react` folder to open up all the files.
13. Start your tasks!
14. To push your code: type `git add .` `git commit -m commit message here` and then `git push origin master` to push your code to master.

## Tasks

- [ ] Please refer to the Trello board to see each of your tasks!


### Tips and Gotchas

- [ ] Test your API and inspect the data in Chrome, _before_ writing the code for the request(s). See screenshots at the root of the project.
- [ ] Try not to hammer your API while developing. Infinite loops in your code might trigger hundreds of requests!
- [ ] Running `npm` commands in the wrong folder will not work. **Be aware of what folder you're in** when working in the command line.
- [ ] The `start` process can sometimes choke after adding new dependencies and may need to be restarted.

## Other Important Information

### Support
One of our principles is “Embrace the Struggle”. What this means to us is that the way you get better at coding is by struggling through problems. If you’re not struggling, you’re probably not learning. When you struggle through a problem, you’re going through steps that will result in you understanding the problem better than if you didn’t struggle with it.
Because of this, we ask you that you work on a problem for at least 20 minutes before seeking support. When you do need support, fill out this form:
https://forms.gle/PLpYJC2vNAGmpDXk9
As soon as you fill it out, Scott or Aryan will DM you on Discord to help you out. 

### Timing
We ask that you complete the project no later than Sunday, June 7th. If you don’t think you’ll be able to meet this deadline, please reach out to Scott and Aryan and we will work with you to figure out an alternate plan.

### Feedback Form
After getting your code review, we ask that you fill out a feedback form that will allow us to improve. We really appreciate as much feedback as you can provide.
